## Project topic 5. Reinforcement Learning agent in Wumpus world

### How to run the project

The project for implementing the Q-Learning agent is built on the Wumpus Hybrid Agent Project. Thus the project supports the Hybrid Agent and Reinforcement learning agent based on Q-Learning 

#### Hybrid agent

1. The following command runs the hybrid agent in default layout

   ```shell
   python wumpus.py -y
   ```

2. The following command runs the hybrid agent in a user defined layout 

```shell
python wumpus.py -y -l wumpus_4x4_1
```

#### Q Learning Agent

1. The following command runs the Q learning agent in default layout with default parameters

   ```shell
   python wumpus.py -q
   ```

2. The following command runs the Q learning agent in a user defined layout 

```shell
python wumpus.py -y -l wumpus_4x4_1
```

3. Learning parameters can be specified with the op
